# Utils

A collection of various workflow, usability and ricing scripts that I frequently uses in my work environment.

## Files

- unzip: a simple unzip script written in Python 3 in order to solve cross-platform encoding problem (<u>**mainly for Chinese users**</u>, not a generic solution)
- ssr: shadowsocksr client based on shadowsocksr-python
- {huami, huami-mod, keygen}: password generators (personal uses)
